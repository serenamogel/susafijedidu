Additionally, some people may be allergic to collagen or have an intolerance to it.<h2>Does collagen have long term effects?</h2>Some studies show that taking collagen supplements for several months can improve skin elasticity, (i.e., wrinkles and roughness) as well as signs of aging. Others have shown that consuming collagen can increase density in bones weakened with age and can improve joint, back and knee pain.<h2>Does collagen cause weight gain?</h2>No, collagen does not cause you to gain weight.

They might also help to lessen wrinkles.<h2>Can collagen powder hurt your kidneys?</h2>Although collagen supplements are unlikely to cause kidney stones for most people when used in moderation, those at a higher risk of developing kidney stones may need to limit their intake.<h2>Can collagen cause hair loss?</h2>Collagen supplements cannot cause hair loss, though too much collagen in the skin can cause another condition called scleroderma.

The body's natural collagen production starts to decrease around age 30, but there could be benefits to getting a head start on boosting the body's collagen status.<h2>How much collagen Should a 60 year old woman take?</h2>Research has also shown that supplementing with collagen may improve skin health in older adults. A review of 11 studies found that taking 2.5–10 grams of collagen per day orally for up to 6 months improved hydration, elasticity, and collagen content of the skin ( 6 ).<h2>Can I take collagen with other vitamins?</h2>Vitamin C is already added to many collagen supplement formulas (like Reserveage Collagen Replenish), but you can also just take your collagen alongside a vitamin C supplement or C-packed foods like citrus, bell-peppers, broccoli, or strawberries to reap the benefits, Axe says.<h2>Does collagen affect estrogen?</h2>Collagen has minimal effect on hormones since it contains subtypes that are found in our bodies. Most people tolerate it well and it is extremely bioavailable.<h2>Can collagen reverse GREY hair?</h2>Since collagen has been shown to fight free radicals in test tubes, it may, in theory, help prevent damage to cells that produce hair color. As a result, it may prevent premature graying or slow down age-related graying ( 9 , 10 ).<h2>Which is better collagen or biotin?</h2>Whether you're looking to strengthen your hair, skin, or nails, collagen is the way to go.

"Collagen is what keeps our skin from sagging, giving us that plump, youthful look."<h2>Is collagen good for hair?</h2>Collagen supplements have been shown to increase the body's hair building proteins, which can result in longer, thicker hair. Collagen may help reduce the appearance of gray hair by supporting the healthy structure of the hair follicle (where the pigment that gives hair its color is produced).<h2>How do you know if you have lack of collagen?</h2>If you don't have enough collagen in your body, you will typically experience signs of aging. This can include wrinkling and sagging of the skin, muscle weakness, aching joints, weak bones, brittle hair and nails, and lackluster skin.<h2>Can collagen make you look younger?</h2>Collagen also has beneficial properties in other parts of your body, too.
