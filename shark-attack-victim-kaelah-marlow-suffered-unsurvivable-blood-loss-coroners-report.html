Populations had increased in the Bay of Plenty and potentially the North Island.</p><p>“Shark attacks are rare but when carried out by a great white shark the attack is likely to be fatal.”</p><p>More research was needed on why great whites were increasing in numbers and “what level of risk they pose for the public”.</p><p>The decision said expert advice showed the risk of attack from great whites increased if someone was swimming alone, in deeper water, and beyond the surf break; swimming in areas where sharks were feeding or were attracted by fishing activity; and swimming in deeper water at dawn or dusk, or when the water was murky or cloudy.</p><p>Marlow had been living in Hamilton and was planning to study at Wintec that year.</p><p>She was remembered by family and friends as an adventurous young woman who moved from Perth only five years previously with her parents, Robert and Michelle, and younger sister Georgia.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Her casket was adorned with a heart-shaped wreath made from shells collected from the beach where she died.
