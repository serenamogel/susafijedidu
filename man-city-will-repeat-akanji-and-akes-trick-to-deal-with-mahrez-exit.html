Captain Ilkay Gundogan has already departed, and now Riyad Mahrez is expected to follow suit. The winger, who did not travel to Tokyo for City’s pre-season tour of Asia, is close to finalizing a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli in a £30million transfer.</p><p>At first glance, this seems like a good deal for Manchester City. £30million for a 32-year-old player who has only two years left on his contract and is no longer a regular starter? It’s a no-brainer. Only Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski have commanded higher transfer fees at that age.</p><p>Mahrez himself seems eager for the move, especially after not getting any game time in the FA Cup or Champions League final. City’s policy is not to hold on to players who want to leave, as long as the money is right, and this deal suits all parties involved.</p><p>However, it should not be underestimated how valuable a player City is losing in Mahrez. He finished the 2022 season as the top scorer with 24 goals, and although Erling Haaland overshadowed him in that aspect, Mahrez still contributed with 15 goals and 13 assists to help secure the treble. In fact, the Algerian winger started more games last season than the previous year.</p><p>Mahrez has been the perfect winger for Guardiola’s system, as he prefers to keep possession and be involved in the team’s build-up play rather than hugging and stretching the touchline. His attacking prowess has been crucial for the team, and like Gundogan, he will be tough to replace.</p><p>This puts Manchester City in an unfamiliar position, as they are now forced to assess targets and strengthen the squad deep into the transfer window. The club may have anticipated Mahrez’s departure and made plans accordingly, but there doesn’t appear to be an immediate replacement lined up to fill his role, as there was with Mateo Kovacic to address the midfield numbers.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmikmqZdmLa1xYywoKWkXaeysbHArWSao5Gjt6p5wKebZpmbmsBuwNGimqRlpKR6pbHApWSwoaSdeq6tx6ucs2WVrba1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
