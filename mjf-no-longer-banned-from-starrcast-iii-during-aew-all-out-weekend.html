Perhaps he upset Thompson by calling him “turkey t*ts” one too many times, but that was the case during Starrcast II.</p><p>It was rather comical to watch <a href=#>MJF get dragged out of Starrcast</a> throughout the entire weekend. He was able to sneak into a couple of events that he shouldn’t have been allowed in. Thanks to top notch security, they took care of Friedman.</p><p>Now thanks to Cody Rhodes calling in a favor, MJF is no longer banned from Starrcast. In fact, he is also going to get his own special show during the convention after he apologized to Conrad Thompson. Now fans will get to enjoy MJF’s show “Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous”… whatever that might entail.</p><p>That didn’t change his attitude for long as Maxwell Jacob Friedman made Conrad Thompson know that he’s still better than the podcaster as soon as Cody was out of the room.</p><p>This should be a very fun event and now that MJF is allowed in things have the potential to be so much better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49wZmpxX6K3p3nNqGSlp56csrN5wZqlp52UYrOzu8xmqq2Zoqewor%2FTZqCioV2ZwrO1zaBkmp2nYq6tuIyorK1lp5qyrLHNnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
