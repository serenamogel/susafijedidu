It serves eight people, so is ideal for family dinners.</p><p>Jamie wrote on his official website: “Hearty and nutritious, minestrone soup is a tasty crowd-pleaser and is super-easy to tweak according to the vegetables you have in the house.”</p><p>The recipe is “super easy” to make, according to the chef, so even kitchen novices can take a stab at it. Have it on the table in just an hour and 20 minutes.</p><h3 id=method><strong>Method</strong></h3><p>1. Peel and thinly chop the garlic and onion. Trim and roughly chop the carrots, celery and courgette. Chuck the vegetables into a big bowl.</p><p>2. Chop the ends off the leek, quarter it lengthways, wash it under water, then cut into slices around 1cm. Transfer to the bowl.</p><p>3. Scrub and dice the potato. Drain the cannellini beans and set aside. Thinly slice the bacon.</p><p>4. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan and whack on a medium heat. Add the bacon and fry a little for two minutes, or until it is golden.</p><p>5. Add the garlic, onion, carrots, celery, courgette, leek, oregano and bay and cook slowly for around 15 minutes, or until the veggies are soft. Ensure you are stirring occasionally.</p><p>6. Add the potato, cannellini beans and plum tomatoes, then the vegetable stock. Stir thoroughly, breaking the tomatoes with the back of a spoon.</p><p>7. Cover the pan with a lid and bring the veggies to the boil slowly. Simmer for around 30 minutes, or until the potato is fully cooked.</p><p>8. Find any tough stalks on the greens, then remove and get rid of them. Then, roughly chop.</p><p>9. Use a rolling pin to smash the pasta into pieces while it’s still in the packet or wrap in a clean tea towel before bashing.</p><p>10. Pierce a chunk of the potato with a sharp knife to check if it’s cooked. If it pierces easily, it is.</p><p>11. Transfer the greens and pasta to the pan, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. Al dente pasta is firm to the bite. Have a taste right before the time is up to make sure it’s cooked well.</p><p>12. If needed, add a splash of stock or water to loosen.</p><p>13. Pick over the basil leaves (optional) and stir in. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Grate over some Parmesan if you’re a cheese fan. Serve on its own or with a slice of wholemeal bread if you want a more filling meal.</p>[ad_2]<br>Post source: <a href=#>Express</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvJmqSinV2kuarCxKuqZqWZo7K0wNGopZ5lo6TCsXnIrGSsraCav26xwKywZqyfYrqit8RmrqKmpJq%2Fbr7EnKCpnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
