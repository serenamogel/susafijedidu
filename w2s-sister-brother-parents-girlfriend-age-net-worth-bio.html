Shortly after, he confessed that the rose gold tinted car was not his and that he had only repackaged the car he had borrowed to give it the rose gold color .&nbsp;All in all, W2S is a jolly fellow, and there’s a lot to know about him.&nbsp;Find answers to frequently asked questions about it below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>W2S Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>British YouTuber was born on November 24th and November 1996.
