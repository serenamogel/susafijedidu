His songs have moved people from all walks of life and in the new A&E two-part 'Biography' documentary <a href=#>'Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On'</a>, Brooks talks about some of the songs that truly defined his career.&nbsp;</p><p>For this list, we first thought we could just explain the importance of each song with our own descriptions. However, that wouldn't be doing justice to these amazing tracks so we're gonna let Brooks explain their importance in his own words, as taken from the documentary.</p><p>So here are the five essential Garth Brooks songs, according to the man himself.</p><h2 class=split>'Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)'&nbsp;</h2><p>"We're driving through Nashville. 65 is split up by about 400 yards of I-40. And I'm driving, 'Much Too Young' starts. It's dawning on me, 'Holy cow! Here it is. Here is the moment.' And for three minutes I'm listening to that and getting to hear your song on your local country radio station? Nothing gets better than that."</p><h2 class=split>'The Thunder Rolls'</h2><p>"'Thunder Rolls' was the last off that record [No Fences (1990] and the biggest single, news-wise, off that record. And the video came out and it was very real. Too much for the video channels to play. So we got banned."&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out the full story of the storm kicked up by 'The Thunder Rolls', <a href=#>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a82275a0-9030-49f6-8437-08e1d5ea22b4.jpg><h2 class=split>'If Tomorrow Never Comes'</h2><p>"We all have dreams of what number ones are. Like somebody calls you up and says 'Hey, you're number one this week!' and you go out in the front yard and you scream, throw the phone... didn't happen that way. Guy's name was Paul â€” all I remember of Paul's last name is Head of Promotions at Capitol Records. And he says, 'Congratulations on your first number one.' I said it's not even in the Top 40 and he goes, 'I've done this long enough. I can't stop this song from going number one'."&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'The Dance'</h2><p>"I can imagine my life, sure can imagine my career but I can't imagine my life without 'The Dance'. That song became&nbsp;the song, I believe, in our career that gave us our own light. And whatever came next, was going to define how big or how small that artist's career would be. That next song was called 'I've Got Friends in Low Places'." &nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'Friends in Low Places'</h2><p>"If you wanna know who Garth Brooks is, 'Friends in Low Places' is Garth Brooks."</p><p>And that's that on that.</p><p>Part 1 of 'Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On' aired on A&E on December 2 and Part 2 was released the very next day, on December 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRon5Gnwal5waumqKOjYsGpsYyrppqcXZ66brvNZpieZWVisrS%2FxKeropmcYsGzrcKkqmaonJbGrbXSrWSdmZ6Ysm6y0aKcp5yjYravecuormaonJawpr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
