The family later relocated to California during his high school years, further fostering his interest in music.</p><h3>Michael Anthony’s Net Worth: $60 Million</h3><p>While attending Arcadia High School, Anthony was actively involved in various musical groups and clubs, ultimately concentrating on playing the guitar. His father eventually purchased a bass guitar and amplifier, leading him to form and perform with his own band. Subsequently, he played with several bands such as “Poverty’s Children”, “Balls”, and “Snake”.</p><p>His breakthrough in the music scene came during his college years at Pasadena City College, where he crossed paths with fellow student Alex Van Halen, a member of another band called “Mammoth”. When Van Halen’s band was in need of a bass player, Anthony was recruited, thus becoming part of the band which later adopted the name “Van Halen”.</p><p>The quartet, comprising of Van Halen’s brother Eddie on guitar, and David Lee Roth on vocals, performed in various venues along Sunset Strip. This eventually led to a contract signing with Warner Bros. In 1978, they released their debut studio album, “Van Halen”, followed by 10 more albums, numerous concerts, and global tours, solidifying their status as one of the most successful rock bands of the 80s. Anthony’s exceptional vocals and bass playing contributed significantly to the band’s success, consequently influencing his net worth.</p><p>After nearly three decades with the band, Michael Anthony officially departed after their reunion tour in 2004. Despite his departure, he participated in the band’s induction into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. He subsequently collaborated with other bands and artists to maintain his presence in the music industry and uphold his wealth. Additionally, he founded and performed with several bands including “The Waboritas”, “Los Tres Gusanos”, and “Planet Us”.</p><p>In 2008, Anthony established yet another band named “Chickenfoot” alongside his former bandmate Sammy Hagar, and Chad Smith, the drummer of Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Joe Satriani. The band has released two studio albums, with reports suggesting a third album is in the works.</p><p>Outside of music, his net worth is also attributed to his own enterprise, the “Mad Anthony Café”, an online platform where he vends various sauces and related products.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Sobolewski has been married to Sue since 1981, whom he met during high school. Together, they have two children and currently reside in Newport Beach, California.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$60 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 20, 1954</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American musician, bass player in the rock Chickenfoot</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Arcadia High School, Pasadena City College</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Sue Sobolewski (m. 1981-)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Walter Sobolewski</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0030959</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame (2007)</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Van Halen (1978)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Poverty’s Children, Balls, Snake, Mammoth, Van Halen, The Waboritas, Los Tres Gusanos, Planet Us, Chickenfoot (2008)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Weird Science, Edward Scissorhands, National Lampoon’s Vacation, The Dark Knight, Johnny Be Good, Pirates of Silicon Valley, Foxcatcher, Six Degrees of Separation, Freddy Got Fingered, Dead in Tombstone, Out of Bounds, All About the Benjamins, Six Pack, The Cavem…</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Father of two daughters, with wife Sue, Taylor (born 1992) and Elisha (born 1985).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Plays bass guitar for Chickenfoot.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Despite being right-handed, he plays bass left-handed.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Enjoys Jack Daniel’s whiskey.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Former bass guitarist for Van Halen.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Son of Polish immigrants.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Attended Dana Junior High and Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Strictly Come Dancing</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series writer – 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><p><br></p></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmikopuYlrKtecCnq6Gnnq7Abq3CnKymrZyWwaawjLCcmqSknXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
