But this, I would have to say, is my forte, my bread and butter. I love making them and I love watching them.”</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=false>“The King of the A- Movie” doesn’t quite have the same ring to it, but at least Butler knows exactly where he stands.
