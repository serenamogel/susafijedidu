In a new interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ScreenRant</a>, though, Massoud broke his silence on the Ezra talk, but he was inevitably light on confirming or denying anything.</p><p>“Yeah. Just manifesting, just manifesting, trying different things. Yeah, there’s not much more I can say about that, but, you know, I had heard murmurings that this role was coming up and this is becoming a real thing. So I just kinda wanted to throw my name in the ring and, yeah, just part of manifesting what you want. I think we live in an age now that’s so different than ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, Hollywood, where there was no social media. It was really just your representatives, putting things out there for you. But now, we have the ability to put things out there for ourselves because of social media and because we can put things out there. So yeah, I just wanted to put it out there, I guess.</p><p>It would be a dream come true. Obviously, I’ve already had one of my dreams come true with Aladdin, but I also think I could just really do it justice. I’ve worked on that kind of big, massive set before on Aladdin. I think I have that under my belt now and thankfully the film did really well, so I think I’ve proven that I can be successful in that environment.&nbsp; I think it would just be a great opportunity to take everything that I learned on a set like Aladdin and implement it into the Star Wars or DC or Marvel universe. We’re talking about manifesting, so yeah, it would mean a lot, it would mean a lot. I think I would also do a solid job and work really hard. I like what they’re doing with that world and how they’re expanding the universe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mena-massoud-ezra-bridger.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=false>Disney Plus Day is happening in November to coincide with the platform’s two-year anniversary, so we’re expecting some major news regarding many high profile upcoming projects.
