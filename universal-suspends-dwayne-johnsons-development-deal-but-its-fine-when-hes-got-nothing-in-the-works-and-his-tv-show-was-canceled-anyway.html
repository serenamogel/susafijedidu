Not only that, but NBC <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled his semi-autobiographical sitcom Young Rock in June after three seasons</a>, so it’s all a bit moot really.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>That being said, unlike J.J. Abrams – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who recently saw his $250 million deal with Warner Bros. halted after delivering absolutely nothing </a>– Johnson did at least manage to star in and produce several high-profile Universal efforts, so there’s that. Things have slowed to a crawl across Hollywood, but the A-lister and entrepreneur is never going to be lacking for things to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TCr7XVnqmsmZxiwLa%2Fz56lnatdmcSixc2eZKOnmKPAsLrSZpuerpWhvLG5xKerZpyVlrlurtStZKKso2KzqrrEZq6hnZ5itaa%2FjKCmrWWepMGptc2gZKKmXam1pnnWqKmkq12Wu6V5x6KqZqymYsCpu9ZmrpqrXZiur6%2FEpZydZZGjxrit2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
