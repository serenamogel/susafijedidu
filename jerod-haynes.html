As a kid, Jerod loved to play basketball. Therefore, during his teen years, Jerod became part of high school basketball tournaments. But growing up, Jerod found himself more inclined to acting.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jerod Has Kept his Marital Life Secret</h2><p>There are rarely any rumors about his baby mama.
