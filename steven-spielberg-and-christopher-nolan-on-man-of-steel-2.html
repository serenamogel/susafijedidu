This sounds like exactly what Warner Bros.’ <strong>new leadership should be doing.</strong> They need these famous directors to work for them again.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Christopher Nolan, for example, only made movies for<strong> Warner Bros. Pictures. After the HBO Max movie release strategy fiasco d</strong>uring the pandemic, Nolan decided to no longer only work for the studio.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Men of Steel Trailer</h2><h2 style=text-align:justify></h2><h2 style=text-align:justify>A Sequel to “Man of Steel” Might Have Steven Spielberg at the Helm.</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>That was a great hit at the box office</strong>, but it was a financial disaster for Warner Bros. It appears that the studio is making overtures to get Nolan and Spielberg, who also made most of his movies solely with<strong> Warners and was quite public in his complaints</strong> of the firm’s choice to release their current pictures on the streaming site, back directing tentpole projects for them.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Peter Safran’s presence</strong> at this lunch meeting is a <strong>fascinating aside.</strong> You may be wondering, “Why?” You see, it’s really not that complicated. The presence of Safran, the new <strong>co-CEO of DC Studios</strong>, has led many to suspect that he and the <strong>two filmmakers may have discussed potential future DC Studios productions.</strong> When we hear Spielberg’s name, we always think of Superman, one of his most famous films.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is His Blackhawk Movie for Dc Studios? Will He Make It?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>A film adaptation of <strong>DC Comics’ Blackhawk had Steven Spielberg attached to direct.</strong> It’s possible that the topic came up again between them. But I think Warner Bros. Discovery would rather have a major name like<strong> Spielberg linked to one of their larger superhero concepts,</strong> and Superman is as large as they come.</p><p style=text-align:justify>We already know that <strong>Henry Cavill will return to the DC Universe as Superman,</strong> and rumors have circulated that Warner Bros. and DC Studios are actively seeking scripts for a sequel to 2013’s Man of Steel.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>New Dc Movies And TV Shows: Catch The Latest Show And Movie Here!</a></strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Two and two together suggest that Zaslav and Safran</strong> may have discussed a potential Superman picture with Spielberg and Nolan. Personally, I’d love to see both of them take on DC films, and I think Warner Bros. would benefit much from having high-profile directors like them at the helm of their DC film projects.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So, what do you think of this information? If a sequel to <strong>“Man of Steel”</strong> were made, would you want Steven Spielberg to helm it?
