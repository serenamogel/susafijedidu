But since she uncovered Pandora’s box, dozens of women have joined her accusations.</span></span></p><p>The last one of her is Laurie Luhn, who was on television since its foundation and stayed with Ailes since she met him. As he has acknowledged in an interview with Daily Intelligencer , his case is one of the most clamorous of sexual exploitation involving the manager.</p><p>In the summer of 1988, Luhn met Ailes during the election campaign of George Bush Senior, for whom the latter worked as a political advisor. Although he had been a flight attendant, Luhn wanted to work in the political communication sector, so at the age of 28 he moved from Texas to Washington to do so.</p><p>At that time, the Texan began working in different campaigns until she contacted Ailes, whom she already knew, to offer to work with him. As soon as he did, the game began.</p><p>Luhn worked with Ailes on political communication campaigns, as long as he was available to “satisfy him when he was in Washington.”</p><p>Ailes invited her to his office and began asking about his personal life. He then offered to dine together and, according to Luhn, she agreed not to have a penny in her pocket. They both dined at a fancy restaurant and, desAfter putting up with the flirtation of what would later be his boss, he accepted a tongue kiss. Next to the kiss, he pulled out a bundle of $ 300 bills so he could “pay his bills.”</p><p>A few days later, the offer arrived. Luhn would work with Ailes in his political communication campaigns, as long as he was available to ” satisfy him when he was in Washington .”</p><p>Thus began a sexual relationship in which Ailes constantly blackmailed her employee. He took her to luxurious suites and forced her to do erotic dances with little models he gave her. He even says he recorded it on video while he did it, no matter how much she told him over and over again that he didn’t like it.</p><p>When Ailes entered the NBC in 1993, they both distanced themselves for a while. But they continued together three years later, already on Fox News: “Then I had a good job and I was about to reject it, but I suffered a kind of Stockholm Syndrome in which I felt like a girl willing to impress Papa Roger.”</p><p>At this time, Luhn was happy to be in a position where he felt valued, but received many pressures around him. At one point, his boss in Washington Kim Hume wanted to kick her out. However, Ailes put land in between and got a promotion for his employee, who was sent to New York.</p><p>Treated like one plugged in by the rest of her classmates, Luhn acknowledges feeling terrible in her new position. In this period they stopped going to bed together, but Ailes constantly asked for phone sex .</p><p>Ailes went on to ask him to bring prostitutes and gave him power to hire new employees whenever they were very attractive.</p><p>Shortly after he began using it as a kind of secretary for “special errands.” He asked her to bring him prostitutes and empowered him to hire new employees whenever they were very attractive . Luhn explains that he used the same strategy he used with her. He invited them to his office, took them out to dinner and then offered to go to a luxury hotel to sleep with them.</p><p>However, after more than a decade in the company, the employee began to have serious emotional problems, derived from the depression she suffered from the labor and sexual pressures of Fox News added to her family situation.</p><p>In this way, he ended up leaving the company and began attending psychiatrists who for years hid what he suffered because of Ailes. But now, after more than a decade after what happened, he has finally dared to tell his truth. A truth that Fox News had been denying for years and finally seems to come to light.</p><p>Although many treat her as a false witness because of her mental problems, Laurie Luhn’s statement adds to the rest of the many that involve Roger Ailes directly with a practice that has cost her coveted position.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSRqr%2BqsYylrKGmXay2rLWMm6Con6KWvanFjJqenmWYqsCjrc2dZKaZoqe2prCMpZiwq6WewW7Azp2YsmWWpMVuusSwqmaqn5yys3nAoqOeq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
