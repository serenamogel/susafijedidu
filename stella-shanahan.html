To begin, she is the daughter of a well-known American football coach, Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.</h3><h2>Stella Shanahan’s net worth</h2><p>Stella is currently studying and is too young to work, so it is safe to assume she does not have any wealth of her own.

The former offensive coordinator also owns a multimillion-dollar home in California.</p><h2>Personal Life of Stella Shanahan</h2><p>Stella is only twelve years old, so it is reasonable to assume that she is currently enrolled in school. She lives a low-key life, in contrast to her celebrity father, who is constantly surrounded by the media.</p><p>She is also not on social media because she is too young to have one. Her father and mother aren’t on social media either.</p><p>Shanahan is currently spending time with her parents, Mandy and Kyle Shanahan, who have been married for fifteen years. She is the tyrant who prefers to spend time with her siblings Carter and Lexi Louise.</p><p>Stella is the well-known child of an extremely private but endearing couple who rarely speak openly about their personal lives. According to Stella’s social media profile, she is quite different from her siblings and parents, who lead quiet lives.
