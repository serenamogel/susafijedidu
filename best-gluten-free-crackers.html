We want salt, herbs, onion, garlic, and occasionally deliciously fatty oil to grace our gluten-free crackers. And the best gluten-free crackers pack a wallop of a crunch. The lack of gluten actually helps crackers to achieve this wonderful texture, so we want the crunchiest of the crunchy only.&nbsp;</p><p>I consistently have a wonderful time munching on <a href=#>gluten-free snacks</a> here at Sporked. They&nbsp; always add something new to the experience. For gluten-free crackers, the lack of gluten always adds a decisive crunch factor that I just adore. And, because these snacks are usually made from seeds and nuts, they also pack wonderful additional flavor. But, what were the best gluten-free crackers we tried?

Seeing this brand makes me laugh out loud every single time, which is as high as a compliment as I can pay a product. Also, crazily, Crunchmaster delivers on its promise. Their products are always crunchy as hell (we ranked the multi-grain variety number two in our <a href=#>best cracker</a> taste test). These roasted garlic, multi-seed, gluten-free, multi-hyphenate crackers are absolutely delicious. They’re the perfect combination of salty, nutty, and pungent. I will forever be purchasing Crunchmaster products from the store because they understand flavor and texture in a way that other brands often do not. Reliable and uniquely delicious, Crunchmaster roasted garlic crackers are the best gluten-free cracker and score a perfect 10.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-CRACKERS_INSET_02-REDUCED.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Dipping</p><strong>Snack Factory Gluten-Free Pretzel Crisps</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>While Crunchmaster is certainly the best gluten-free cracker, don’t sleep on these Snack Factory pretzel crisps, either. I took these home with me and munched on the entire bag in a single day. These taste just like the regular, non gluten-free Snack Factory pretzel crisps (a top performer in our <a href=#>best pretzels</a> taste test) but are much, much crunchier. Gluten-free products tend to be much more so than their gluten-filled counterparts. These pretzel crisps are made with corn starch, potato starch, and rice flour (three ingredients that are known to provide maximum crunch). The flavor is on point, too. They’re toasty, salty, and delicious. Because they’re so sturdy and salty, Snack Factory gluten-free pretzel crisps are ideal for dipping.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-CRACKERS_INSET_03-REDUCED.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Nut</p><strong>Blue Diamond Pecan Nut Thins</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I wasn’t a huge fan of these up front, but they grew on me. It should also be said that staff writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> and managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> went absolutely bonkers for them. The taste is incredibly buttery and nutty due to their pronounced pecan flavor. It’s also very salty. Personally, my brain registers pecans as something that’s more of a dessert flavor, an ingredient that should be paired with sugar and cream. Still, these pecan nut thins have such a uniquely bold flavor. Everybody else around the office keeps eating them plain, but I would crumble these on some <a href=#>ice cream</a> in a hurry.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-CRACKERS_INSET_04-REDUCED.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Ingredients</p><strong>HU Grain Free Sea Salt Crackers</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>The ingredients used in these crackers are choice, my friends: Shallots, apple cider, rosemary, thyme, chia seed, and flax seed combine to make a deliciously nutty, seedy, seasoned cracker that you won’t be able to put down. Hu rather piously touts that they’re a better product than their competitors. Per the Instacart <a href=# rel=noopener>details</a>, Hu’s copy says, “No refined starches. No greasy fingers. Just say no to crappy crackers.” Maybe it’s just marketing, but I buy into it. These felt healthy and delicious, two qualities I like in my snacks. This is the best gluten-free cracker for those who want natural, honest ingredients in their food.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-CRACKERS_INSET_05-REDUCED.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Corn</p><strong>Good Thins Corn & Sea Salt</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Good Thins corn crackers are super crunchy and have a pronounced corn flavor. Really, the only two flavors here are corn and salt, but I love how simple yet delicious they are. They taste almost like a gluten-free Frito, but in crispy cracker form. Good Thins, while a healthy front-facing product, do contain a bit of oil and fat, so it’s not 100% good for you. It reads quite junk food-adjacent to me. Still, they’re delicious. The best gluten-free product for people who like corn chips are Good Thins.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_GF-CRACKERS_INSET_06-REDUCED.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Protein Punch</p><strong>Wilde Sea Salt and Vinegar Chicken Chips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Nobody else likes these but guess what, baby? I do. These are chicken-flavored salt and vinegar chips that pack a lot of protein (20 grams per bag!). The flavor is salty, tangy, and savory. What’s not to like? If you’re trying to pack more protein in your diet, but still want to be munching on crackers and chips, Wilde’s sea salt and vinegar chicken chips are the best gluten-free chip for you. They’re made from actual chicken breast (like Rhett told me once, you can dehydrate anything), and they taste like it!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><br><strong>Other products we tried</strong>: Good Thins Sea Salt, Blue Diamond Almond Nut Thins, Bob’s Red Mill Rosemary Oat, Crunchmaster Rosemary Olive Oil, Milton’s Sea Salt, Milton’s Olive Oil, Wasa, 365 Sunflower Himalayan Sea Salt, Crunchmaster Mediterranean Herb.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFus8uuq56mXZu%2FprGMnKmam5uav7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
