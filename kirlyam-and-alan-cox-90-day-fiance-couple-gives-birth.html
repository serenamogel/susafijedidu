But that doesn’t mean that every couple gets their happily ever after, either.</p><p>Kirlyam and Alan Cox, however, are one of those beautiful exceptions. They lived the dream and made it and are a happy couple. And this summer, we told you that <a href=#>Kirlyam was pregnant</a>.</p><p>They were due in September, but sometimes the best things take a little extra time to prepare. (And yes, of course there are baby pictures)</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>There are schemers and cheaters and toxic relationships left and right on 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>But we can’t forget about the good relationships, too.</p><p>Alan Cox was doing his work as a Mormon missionary in Brazil when he met Kirlyam.</p><p>The two of them hit it off. And though there were issues — Kirlyam may have looked a bit like a mail-order bride to some of Alan’s peers, while marrying Kirlyam meant leaving her family behind in Brazil for Kirlyam — they went through with their engagement and got married.</p><p>Honestly, we’ve loved watching the two of them be adorable nerds together on Instagram, whether they were going out to see Wonder Woman or geeking out about Harry Potter.</p><p>The most dramatic part of their relationship, in our estimation, is that Kirlyam’s family couldn’t afford the trip and had to watch a livestream of Kirlyam and Alan getting hitched.</p><p>In fact, the only downside to these two is that their high-on-love, low-on-drama relationship doesn’t make them as juicy fodder for the 90 Day Fiance cameras (or their spin-offs).</p><p>But check out their latest adorable development!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Baby Liam was born on the 6th of October, 2017.</p><p>Alan Cox took to Instagram to share the wonderful news:</p><p>"Welcome to the world Liam Jordan da Costa Cox. Born 10/06/17 at 7:57 pm. 6 lbs 15 oz 20 inches long. Baby and momma are doing great. I’m so proud of you @kirlyam_. You are a true warrior. I love you so much!"</p><p>He also translated it, like most of his updates about Kirlyam, into Portuguese for Kirlyam’s relatives. Awww!</p><p>She pushed for twenty hours, which is enough to impress us but the thought of that makes us want to curl up and die.</p><p>Sharing an up-close photo of precious baby Liam, Alan shared the experience of every new parent.</p><p>"Loving life right now! Well except the no sleep part.. hahahahaha but then I look at Liam and suddenly I’m not so tired."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He’s so cute!</p><p>Alan Cox elaborated about Kirlyam’s labor experience.</p><p>"I do not have the words to describe what I feel for this wonderful woman. I am so proud of her. She was an absolute warrior in the delivery room. After 20 hours of active labor she still had the energy and drive to sacrifice her body for Liam."</p><p>We can only imagine how tough it was for Kirlyam, especially given the difference in stature between herself and her husband.</p><p>(Not every big baby becomes a tall adult, but there’s something to be said for the effort of pushing a very tall man’s baby out of a very small woman’s uterus)</p><p>Alan Cox continued:</p><p>"I will forever be grateful and love this woman for all time and eternity. @kirlyam_ thank you"</p><p>These two are so sweet with each other. That tribute is even more precious than Alan’s glowing face as he shopped for baby clothes during the summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And to think that mere days before, the two had been throwing up their hands and wondering when Liam, due in September, would ever enter the world!</p><p>Kirlyam made her own, much more succinct post. Again, her baby was born less than a week ago, and if we’d just pushed for 20 hours, you wouldn’t catch us so much as tapping "like" on Instagram.</p><p>"Welcome to the world Liam. We love you so very much!!!!"</p><p>She included some blue hearts and, of course, a Portuguese translation.</p><p>The next time that 90 Day Fiance makes you feel cynical about relationships, about marriage, and about the show itself, maybe think of this growing family.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Which Couples Are (Somehow) Still Together?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z9cLfIq6OymZ1irq%2BwjJqjmqZdmLy5eZhpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmm5%2Bqva2xjKCgr52jYq%2BqvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
