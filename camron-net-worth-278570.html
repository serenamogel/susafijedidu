(Us Now). He started his musical career in the mid 1990s, rapping together with Big L, Mase and his cousin Bloodshed in a group called Children Of The Corn. Camron had no other choice but to continue solo, after the death of Bloodshed in 1997 and Big L in 1999. He fully established himself as a rapper, after meeting The Notorious B.I.G who was instrumental in his success as he made him land a recording deal under Untertainment label, distributed by Epic Records. Along with the release of his debut album, Confessions of Fire, he gained popularity of global dimensions. Thanks to the hit singles like Feels Good (featuring Usher) and Horse and Carriage, the album cruised to number 6 on the Billboard top 200. Ever since, he has seen the release of 10 more albums, each giving its own contribution to generating Camron's current wealth. But apart from his music career, Camron appeared on screen as well, making his debut in the Damon Dash produced film, Paid in Full (2003).
