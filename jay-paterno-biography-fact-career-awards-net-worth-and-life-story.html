Also active in politics, Paterno unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania in 2014.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=playing-career></span>Playing career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paterno played on the Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1986-1990 under his father Joe Paterno. He was a reserve quarterback during his senior year, in which he lettered. He also played for State College Area High School.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=coaching-career></span>Coaching career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paterno was on Penn State’s staff for 17 seasons, 12 of which he served as the quarterbacks coach. He was the mastermind for creating Penn State’s “HD offense” which utilized skill players to touch the ball in a variety of ways. Derrick Williams (2005-2008) is one of many players who thrived in this system. Previously, Paterno served as the tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator. Prior to being on the PSU staff, he served as a graduate assistant at Virginia from 1990–92, Wide Receivers and Tight Ends Coach at Connecticut in 1993, and as the quarterbacks coach at James Madison in 1994. Paterno’s coaching career at Penn State came to an end following the hiring of new head coach Bill O’Brien on January 7, 2012. In 2011 Jay was named best quarterbacks coach in the Big Ten by rivals.com. In 2008, he was named one of the best offensive coaches in the country following a rose bowl season. Jay coached Micheal Robinson to a Heisman finalist season in 2005.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=after-penn-state></span>After Penn State<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since his father’s death and his dismissal, Paterno has written several guest columns, including this one. He has spoken at several young voters rallies including one in one sponsored by PSU Votes, a nonpartisan political initiative where both he and Penn State women’s basketball coach Coquese Washington spoke.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jay has four siblings: Diana, Mary Kay, David, and Scott. Unlike his late father, who was a staunch Republican, Jay is a Democrat, and supported Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.</p><p>In October 2013, several outlets reported that Paterno was considering running as a Democrat in Pennsylvania’s 5th congressional district, which is based in State College. Instead, Paterno announced in February 2014 that he would be a candidate in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in the 2014 election. Ultimately, he withdrew from the race in March 2014, citing the desire to avoid a legal battle over a challenge to his petition to achieve ballot access. Paterno has five children. He has a son named Joseph Vincent Paterno III passing down the name to his own son. His son is mentioned many times in his book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn666ec%2Baq56qnqR6o7XOoKmaqJiueqetwq1knJmimrKzecCwmKuco2K7psCMsKarrJhirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
