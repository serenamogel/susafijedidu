In the 1960s, the focus of Larson’s preaching centered mainly on the leftist political ideology, sexually suggestive lyrics, Eastern religious mysticism, and antisocial behavior of many of the era’s rock musicians.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=debates-with-satanists></span><span><span>Debates with Satanists</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the Satanic Panic of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Larson debated, interviewed, and confronted Satanists on numerous occasions. He hosted Nikolas Schreck (a gothic rock musician and lead singer of Radio Werewolf) and Zeena LaVey (once the spokesperson for the Church of Satan and later a priestess in the Temple of Set) on two occasions.</p><p>During their first appearance, the pair defended Satanism, while during their second appearance in 1997, they defended Setianism. Larson debated the pair and tried unsuccessfully to convert them at times. On his Talk-Back radio show, Larson also debated, interviewed, and challenged “Nazi Satanist” James Mason.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=talkback></span><span><span><i>TalkBack</i></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Larson launched TalkBack, a two-hour weekday call-in show aimed primarily at teenagers and frequently focusing on teen-oriented topics such as role-playing games and rock music, in 1982.</p><p>Larson had come to embrace contemporary Christian music by this point, including styles like heavy metal and rap, and actively promoted the music and artists on his show. By the late 1980s, Larson was frequently heard on the air performing exorcisms on callers, a practice that would come to define his later ministry.</p><p>Satanism and Satanic ritual abuse were frequently brought up in conversation. Glen Benton of Deicide, a death metal performer, became a regular caller, as did Bob Guccione Jr., the eldest son of Penthouse founder Bob Guccione and the founder of the music magazine Spin.</p><p>Guccione Jr. once paid Larson to go on tour with American thrash metal band Slayer and write about it in the 1980s. Larson dabbled in fiction with Dead Air (1991), which was largely ghostwritten by Lori Boespflug and Muriel Olson.</p><p>Larson’s later novels, Abaddon (1993) and The Senator’s Agenda (1996), both linked Satanic ritual abuse to political corruption; the latter was written largely by Larson and his second wife.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bob-larson-ministries></span><span>Bob Larson Ministries</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lori Boespflug, a former vice president of Bob Larson Ministries, claims that much of Dead Air, while presented as Larson’s work, is actually her own. A letter from Larson’s lawyer backs up these claims, warning him of his “potential liability to Lori,” predicting that “the role Lori has played” will lead her to “demand recognition and/or profit participation” in Dead Air and its sequels.</p><p>Larson returned to the radio airwaves after a two-year hiatus in 2004, with a daily talk show heard on a network of radio stations, as well as simulcast and archived on the Internet.</p><p>Larson is still active today. His ministry claims to provide an alternative counseling outlet for people struggling with violence, self-mutilation, multiple personality disorders, Satanic ritual abuse, or molestation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bob-larson-exorcism-exorcist-bob-larson></span><span><span>Bob Larson Exorcism | Exorcist Bob Larson</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2013, Vice magazine filmed Larson’s visit to several small towns in Ukraine, where he performed exorcisms alongside three young women – his 18-year-old daughter Brynne Larson and her friends Tess and Savannah Sherkenback (18 and 21 respectively, collectively known as The Teenage Exorcists).</p><p>As a result, the Teenage Exorcists responded to Vice Media’s video, claiming that they “question the journalistic integrity of this Vice Media story and are disappointed by how we were falsely portrayed.” Larson offered exorcisms via Skype in 2014 (for a donation of $295).</p><p>His Skype exorcisms were featured in a 2014 segment of the satirical show The Daily Show, in which he told correspondent Jessica Williams, “Skype is a great technology to stare down the Devil, go after him, and kick him back to hell.” However, later in the same segment, he stated that “tweeting an exorcism would be ridiculous.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bob-larson-books></span><span>Bob Larson Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Rock & Roll: The Devil’s Diversion (Creation House, 1967)</li><li>Hippies, Hindus, and Rock & Roll (Creation House, 1969)</li><li>Rock & the Church (Creation House, 1971)</li><li>The Day Music Died (Creation House, 1972)</li><li>Hell on Earth (Creation House, 1974)</li><li>Babylon Reborn (Creation House, 1976)</li><li>Rock, Practical Help for Those Who Listen to the Words and Don’t like What They Hear (Tyndale, 1980)</li><li>Larson’s Book of Cults (Tyndale House Publishers, Wheaton, Ill, 1982)</li><li>Larson’s Book of Family Issues (Tyndale, 1986)</li><li>Strange Cults in America (Tyndale, 1986)</li><li>Larson’s Book of Rock (Tyndale, 1987)</li><li>Your Kids and Rock (Tyndale, 1988)</li><li>Satanism: the Seduction of America’s Youth (Lightning Source, 1989)</li><li>Straight Answers on the New Age (Thomas Nelson, 1989)</li><li>Tough Talk About Tough Issues (Tyndale, 1989)</li><li>Larson’s New Book of Cults (Tyndale, 1989)</li><li>Dead Air: A Novel (Thomas Nelson, 1991)</li><li>Abaddon: A Novel (Thomas Nelson, 1993)</li><li>The Senator’s Agenda (Thomas Nelson, 1995)</li><li>In The Name of Satan: How the Forces of Evil Work and What You</li><li>Can Do to Defeat Them (Thomas Nelson, 1996)</li><li>UFO’s and the Alien Agenda (Thomas Nelson, 1997)</li><li>Extreme Evil: Kids Killing Kids (Nelson Reference, 1999)</li><li>Larson’s Book of Spiritual Warfare (Nelson, 1999)</li><li>Shock Talk: The Exorcist Files (WestBow, 2001)</li></ul><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-bob-larson></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Bob Larson</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-bob-larson></span><span>Who is Bob Larson?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Larson is an American radio and television evangelist, and a pastor of Spiritual Freedom Church in Phoenix, Arizona.
