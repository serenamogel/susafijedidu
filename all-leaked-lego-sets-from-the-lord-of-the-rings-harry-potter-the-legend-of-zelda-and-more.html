Recent leaks revealed some of the most iconic-looking LEGO sets depicting some of your favorite locations, vehicles, and characters from some of the most iconic franchises in history.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>The leak comes from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the German website Promo Bricks</a>, which got its information from a source who participated in a LEGO survey and gained access to sets that have yet to be released. LEGO has not confirmed these sets are in production, so please take the following tidbits with a grain of salt, as you should with all leaked information. Some noteworthy sets are on this list, so let’s look at what’s in store.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Snow White’s house</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Snow-White.jpg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>In the first leaked set, we find&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snow White</a>‘s house, where the seven dwarves and Snow White herself are present. Since Disney’s 100th anniversary is just around the corner, it makes perfect sense to mark it with a set from one of the most iconic Disney films. In terms of its size, it should be around 2500 pieces.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Maleficent and the Dragon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sleeping-Beauty-Maleficent-and-the-Dragon.jpg><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>The other princess-related LEGO set appears to be Maleficent and the Dragon, based on the animated classic&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sleeping Beauty</a>. This set will include a fully buildable Dragon Dragon, along with Maleficent and Prince Phillip as separate LEGO bricks. Once complete, it will depict Prince Phillip’s thrilling battle with the Dragon. It should be around 1250 pieces, and Disney is likely to release it along with Snow White’s house for its 100th anniversary.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Simba</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Simba-in-The-Lion-King.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>The next Disney set leaked is a buildable Simba from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lion King</a>. The piece is not part of a larger set, so users can build the lion in all his pride. According to the leak, this build of Simba will be 1353 pieces, 11 inches high, six inches wide, and nearly 10 inches deep. You might even be able to open his mouth when it’s complete, but we’d be&nbsp;really&nbsp;impressed if the completed Simba could actually sing.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Donald Duck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Donald-Duck-The-New-Neighbor.jpg><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>As with Simba,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Duck</a>&nbsp;might also be available for you to build soon as well. According to the leak, he is expected to be a bit easier to construct, as he will only contain around 1000 pieces — differing from the BrickHeadz Donald Duck release, which is 90 pieces. He will stand 11 inches high, six inches wide, and seven inches deep when completed.&nbsp;Donald will be situated on a base donning his iconic outfit, so you can be sure that — as usual — he won’t be wearing any pants.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Legend of Zelda – The Great Deku Tree</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Great-Deku-Tree-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild.jpg><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>Gamers will surely get excited about this leak, as it contains a set of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>‘s&nbsp;Great Deku Tree. This one is a bit more interesting than the others, as it consists of an additional feature. As opposed to a single set, this is a 2-in-1 set, depicting both&nbsp;Ocarina of Time&nbsp;and&nbsp;Breath of the Wild’s&nbsp;Great Deku Tree. Buyers will also receive two mini-figures of Link and can also construct Hestu with leftover pieces from the&nbsp;Breath of the Wild&nbsp;set. According to the leak, it will include 1920 pieces.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Lord of the Rings – Barad-dûr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Barad-dur.jpg><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>Prepare for a perilous trek into Mordor. Fans of Middle Earth will be pleased to learn that a Barad-dûr set is also part of the leaks. Sauron’s fortress is easily one of the most iconic locations in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a>, and now you can make one for yourself. The set will include Sauron, Sam, Frodo, and several Orcs as mini-figures and reportedly stands 32 inches tall, 17 inches wide, and 14 inches deep, with a staggering 4,000 pieces total. Just don’t stare too long into the Eye of Sauron.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Medieval Village</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/LEGO-medieval-village.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>The leak also mentions a set that is not based on any franchise, the LEGO Medieval Village set. It should contain a few medieval houses, some trees, many multiple villagers as mini-figures, as well as animals. It should include 3200 pieces in all. Let’s just hope the instructions for the set don’t date back to the same time period.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ultimate Collector Series: The Burrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Burrow-in-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets.jpg><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>The first <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> set included in the leak depicts the iconic Weasley home, the Burrow. Previous sets depicting the house have been released before, but the latest is part of the Ultimate Collector Series, so it’s set to be bigger — and more expensive. This version of the set will likely have a mapped-out interior as well. The leaks state that it will be nearly 20 inches high, nearly 10 inches wide, and nine inches deep. It should consist of 2388 pieces and have the entire Weasley family as mini-figures.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Sorting Hat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Sorting-Hat-in-Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosophers-Stone.jpg><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>The next Harry Potter set included in the leak is the Sorting Hat. Buyers will have the chance to construct the jolly hat Hogwarts students wear to determine which House they will belong to during their time at the school. We do not have details about the size of the set, but it should be on the larger side and fully buildable. As a precaution, you should probably avoid putting this hat on your head.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ultimate Collector Series: Jabba’s Sail Barge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Wars-Jabbas-Barge.jpg><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>The next set is a part of the Ultimate Collector Series and currently stands as the only leaked set from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a> franchise. The Khetanna is Jabba’s Sail Barge, and while it has appeared in LEGO form before, this should be the biggest and most involved version of the set yet. Like some of the other Star Wars sets, Jabba’s barge will likely come with numerous mini-figures, cherry-picked from the multitude of characters featured in related scenes from Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>The set should consist of 6500 pieces, measuring up to 10 inches tall, nearly 10 inches wide, and 23 inches long. It would be safe to assume that — if the leak is real — the interior will be filled and fairly accurate to the movie scene.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gotham City</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/batman-animated-series-opening.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>As the only&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC</a>&nbsp;set on the list, this one presents a LEGO Art version of Gotham City. The set seems to be based on Batman: The Animated Series, with tall buildings and police blimps filling the skyline. According to leaks, it will come with mini-figures of Batman, Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, and Phantasm, further demonstrating its ties to The Animated Series. In total, 3238 pieces will be available, with an overall height of 12 inches and a width of 30 inches.</p><h2 id=h-x-mansion data-injectable=false>X-Mansion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Deadpool-Xaviers-Mansion.jpg><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>As we approach the final LEGO set in our list, we can literally hear the X-Men theme intensifying. The X-Mansion, home to Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, will soon be available in LEGO form and remains the only Marvel item on the list. A total of 3122 pieces will be included in the X-Mansion set, including the Professor Charles Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Storm, Beast, Sabertooth, Cyclops, Mystique, and Emma Frost mini-figures. According to the leak, it will be 10 inches tall, 21 inches wide, and six inches deep.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Again, these sets are leaked, so none of them are guaranteed to be released in the future. However, with&nbsp;Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Disney, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and&nbsp;Legend of Zelda&nbsp;all included in the lineup, we’re desperately hoping to see at least a few of these hit shelves. Hopefully, they won’t break the bank.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaGyorfEnWSlnZekerSx06xkn6qfonq1tMRmo6iqlGK8p3nToZxmqpmjtLR5x5qpq7Fdpby1wMSrZK2glWK5prPEp5tmp5Zix6a4w5pkmqaUYrqwvsRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
