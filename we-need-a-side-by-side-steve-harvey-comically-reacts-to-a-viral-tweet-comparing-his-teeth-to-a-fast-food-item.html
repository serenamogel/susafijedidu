It appeared as if the fast food meal reminded the woman of Harvey’s thick mustache, teeth, and his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wide grin</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Steve-Harvey-tells-social-media-users-to-22stop22-after-they-compare-his-teeth-and-smile-to-a-particular-food-item-600x331.jpg><p>“Why they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">give</a> me these big onion slices, my burger look like Steve Harvey,” she penned.&nbsp;</p><p>Her tweet quickly garnered over 17.4 million views with more than 340,000 interactions. It wasn’t long before Harvey received word about his non-living double, and issued a PSA to those who kept sending him the now-viral tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>“Stop sending me this $!&#,” he wrote while attaching a screenshot of the burger on his Twitter page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Stop sending me this $!&# 😂 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aMKGo4794C</a></p>— Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) <a href=#>August 1, 2023</a></figure><p>The “Family Feud” host also added a laughing emoji, so it can be inferred that he did not take the comparison to heart. Several fans also found amusement in Harvey’s reply, and even applauded him for the way he handled the gag.</p><p>“Wow, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took</a> the joke so well.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actually</a> crying because Steve Harvey was sitting at home watching TV and then a fast food worker put onions on a burger and now we are here.”&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Now</a> I cannot unsee it @IAmSteveHarvey.”</p><p>“We <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">need</a> a side-by-side…”</p><p>“Steve Harvey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finding</a> Steve Harvey memes is always hilarious.”&nbsp;</p><p>Harvey regularly interacts with fans online and has no problem <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joining</a> in on the jokes made about him from time to time. A few weeks ago, the “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” actor was the latest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">target of a death hoax</a> after he was accidentally mixed up in a death announcement on Twitter involving someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>The hashtag #RipHarvey became a trending topic following the passing of a popular Kentucky sports fanatic named Harvey. However, several people began believing that the hashtag was meant for the beloved philanthropist.&nbsp;</p><p>After the hashtag made it to Twitter’s “United Stated trends” page, Harvey addressed the hearsay by poking fun at the viral tweet while using another popular meme of himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49xZmlpX6yybrrEnptmmV2otqWxjJuwZquZmbJuv9OerZ5lmJa%2Ft7HYZpqopZmYrq242GapnpmTqcBuwM5mmGaumaeurXnTsJyerF2YvK68wKugp59dnba0edOenK2gXam8bq2Mn5isrF2bvLCwjKKrnqVf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
