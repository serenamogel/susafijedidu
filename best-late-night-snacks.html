But if you’ve never had post-night-out nugs, Checkers fries at sunrise, or an entire bag of literally any chips at 2 a.m., you haven’t tasted snacks at their peak. Food simply tastes better when you eat it in the middle of the night. But not all late night snacks are created equal. Here’s what the Sporked crew recommends when a craving strikes in the wee hours, and don’t worry—we’ve got everything from crunchy munchies to magical midnight meals. These are the best late night snacks to buy at the grocery store.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Samyang Buldak Korean Hot Spicy Chicken Stir-Fried Ramyun Noodles</strong></a><p>Ho. Ly. Crap. When I tried Buldak Noodles for the first time in college, everything changed. They are the spiciest, umami-est <a href=#>instant noodles</a> you will ever have. Plus, they are saucy as all get out and about as chewy and sproingy as instant noodles can be. No wonder they are Sporked’s fave spicy instant noodles. These are a game changer for that 2 a.m. realization that you have to study for three more hours and the only thing that can possibly keep you awake is a bowl of extremely delicious spicy noods.&nbsp;Try at your own risk, though—I’m a fan of spicy things and I still think these noodles have quite a kick. They are certainly not for the faint of tongue.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>College Students Rejoice! It’s the 10 Best Instant Ramens</a></strong></p><p>Why wait till the morning to <a href=# rel=noopener>make waffles</a> when you could eat them while <a href=# rel=noopener>staying up late </a>and <a href=# rel=noopener>swappin’ manly stories</a>?! (Deep cut, I know). <a href=#>Frozen waffles</a> are one of the best late night snacks, whether you eat them straight out of the toaster or doctor them up with <a href=#>vanilla ice cream</a> and <a href=#>chocolate sauce</a>. Especially when those waffles are Krusteaz Belgian Waffles, the only toaster waffles we tried that actually taste like real-live Belgian waffles. They are fluffy, sweet, and buttery, and as Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> put it, they “taste so close to homemade—scratch that—restaurant-made waffles it is mind blowing.” So, save yourself the DoorDash fees from the 24 hour diner near you (Denny’s, let’s call it what it is), pop one of these in the toaster instead, eat it on the couch or in bed, and love your life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Get Toasty with the Best Frozen Waffles</a></strong></p>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>On the Border Salsa Con Queso</strong></a><strong> + </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>On the Border Café Style Tortilla Chips</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>If there is one brand Sporked has deemed the king of <a href=#>chips</a> and <a href=#>queso</a>, it’s On the Border. Their chips taste freshly made, with a “fresh out of the fryer” canola oil taste, and the queso “can be eaten hot&nbsp;or&nbsp;cold.” It’s that good. And for those who can’t sleep and have to wake up and find a quick snack at 2:47 a.m., what better late night snack than the best grocery store chips out there and a queso that you don’t even have to heat up for it to taste good. If there’s one thing I’m not On the Border about, it’s that I will be purchasing some of these chips and a jar of this queso this week.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Get Cheesy with the 5 Best Store-Bought Quesos</a> + <a href=#>7 Best Tortilla Chips for Dipping in Anything</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Frosted S’mores Pop-Tarts</strong></a><p>You may be thinking, “Yeah, I get Pop-Tarts being on this list of the best late night snacks, but why S’mores specifically? Why not Brown Sugar or Wild Berry?” To which I would say, try a S’mores Pop-Tart warm. According to the Sporked team, the warm S’mores Pop-Tarts “transform into a literal, actual toasted <a href=#>s’more</a>. The <a href=#>marshmallow </a>is gooey. The <a href=#>chocolate</a> is melty. The pastry takes on a roasted aroma.” Perfect for when you’re out in the woods camping—or camping out in the kitchen with friends at all hours of the night. These Pop-Tarts are game changers, whether you take the time to heat one up or just have it at room temp.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The 7 Best Pop-Tart Flavors</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tina’s Breakfast Burrito, Handcrafted, Egg, Sausage & Cheddar Cheese</strong></a><p>Sometimes, you need more than a late night snack. Sometimes you need a whole dang late night meal. Enter Tina’s Handcrafted Egg, Sausage, & Cheddar Cheese Breakfast Burrito. Late night burritos are a staple in any twentysomething’s life, and if you don’t have the chance to grab one on your way home from a night out, keeping one of these Tina’s burritos in your freezer will ensure you have a warm, gooey, flavor bomb of a <a href=#>breakfast burrito</a> that can be ready for you just minutes after you walk through the door. But this isn’s just any frozen burrito. Managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> described it as “a cheesier version of the McDonald’s breakfast burrito in the best way possible. The sausage is peppery and a little smokey. It’s super cheesy and soft.” This is literally a fast food breakfast burrito you can have at the ready in your own home, and we are here for it.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The Best Frozen Breakfast Burritos for an Easy Morning Meal</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>El Monterey Extra Crunchy Southwest Chicken Taquitos</strong></a><p>You may have noticed these very taquitos sneaking on several of best snack for ___ lists, and that’s simply because we firmly believe these are one of the best snacks, periodt. According to Gwynedd, these taquitos’ shells have a “crispy, bubbly coating that gives them a little more crunch,” as well as a whole lot of fried flavor. Plus, the filling in these things isn’t just meat or beans like a lot of taquitos. No, these bad boys are stuffed to the brim with chicken, cheese, peppers, and beans. Meet your newest 11 p.m. obsession.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>We’re on a Roll with the 6 Best Frozen Taquitos</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>TGI Fridays Mozzarella Sticks</strong>&nbsp;</a><p>Fewer things scream “late night snack” louder than mozzarella sticks. Well, maybe anything with actual vocal cords. But snack-wise? These fried delights have the title of “most iconic late night food” pretty much on lock. The crispetty-crunchetty outside, the stretchy, ooey-gooey center—there are very few things not to love about mozzarella sticks. But how do you get them when it’s too late at night for restaurant sticks? Sporked’s pick for the best frozen mozz sticks at the grocery store: TGI Friday’s. Friday’s brand sticks have “good flavor, great quality cheese, and a crispy, crunchy panko breading.” SAY LESS.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The 5 Best Frozen Mozzarella Sticks</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Original Klondike Bar</strong></a><p>Let’s be real. Many of us would stay up late for a Klondike bar. Or at least, that is definitely something I would doOOoo. Sometimes you don’t want the extra frill of a <a href=#>sundae cone</a>, a mint It’s-It, or a frozen Snickers bar. Sometimes all you want is light, fluffy ice cream and thin, shattery chocolate (“like a sheet of chocolate glass,” as Jordan so eloquently put it) and that’s it. On these things, Klondike absolutely delivers. If you like sweets, this is one of the best late night snacks by far.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>What Would You Do for the 5 Best Klondike Bar Flavors</a></strong></p>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Fast Fixin’ Chicken Breast Nuggets&nbsp;</strong></a><p>I said earlier there was nothing more late night than mozzarella sticks…I forgot <a href=#>chicken nuggets</a> existed. Is there anything better than hot, crispy nugs after a night out at a drive-in movie, followed by <a href=#>boba</a>, followed by car troubles, followed by a long walk home, followed by getting home at 12:36 a.m.? I would argue there is not. To this day, I still believe it was chicken nuggets that fixed my friend’s car. But I digress. Sporked’s pick for the best frozen chicken nuggets are Fast Fixin’ Chicken Breast Nuggets, which Jordan describes as “breathtakingly flavorful.” Have you ever heard a nugget described that way before? I didn’t think so. Definitely give these a try. Jordan even said these (*gasp*) “might not even need sauce”!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The 5 Best Frozen Chicken Nuggets</a></strong></p>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Foster Farms Honey Crunchy Corn Dogs</strong></a>&nbsp;<p>Sometimes all you want at 10 p.m. is to pretend you are in a mall food court or wandering around the county fair. Best way to achieve that? Nope, not dreaming. It’s eating a corndog! And the best frozen corndog for your late night snacking pleasure is none other than Foster Farms Honey Crunchy Corn Dogs, a classic freezer aisle staple. It may be a chicken dog instead of beef, but “this chicken corn dog is juicy, sweet, and meaty with a delightfully soft, puffy texture,” according to Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo. As Danny said, a corndog doesn’t have to be all beef to be a stellar product.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Stick It with the 5 Best Frozen Corn Dogs</a></strong></p><strong>Trader Joe’s Pork Gyoza Potstickers</strong>&nbsp;<p>Lastly but not leastly, late night dumplings. Hooooooo boi, there are few things in life better than a late night dumpling. And there are few frozen dumplings better than the Trader Joe’s Pork Gyoza Potstickers. I will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sing the praises of these things</a> until eternity, but if you are looking for actual helpful descriptors, Jordan put it best: “They are so juicy, flavorful, and meaty. They’re gingery and, while super savory, have a hint of sweetness that is really pleasant.” YUM. Truly nothing better than late night dumps with friends (or by yourself at 3:30 a.m. over the sink; any consumption method is acceptable).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>The 7 Best Frozen Dumplings</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuuMCtnGammZy1tXnSp5ico6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
