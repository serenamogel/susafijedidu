She met Fleetwood Mac while working with them on a project, photography for one of their albums. Her images made an effect on the band, and she eventually met them while they were producing music in the 1980s. Simultaneously, her future husband was in a public romance with a mutual acquaintance, singer Stevie Nicks. Stevie and Lindsey previously had an on-again, off-again romance that began in the 1970s while the couple pursued music careers. Kristen is also the owner of an architectural and interior design firm in Los Angeles.</p><p>Aside from her job, she enjoys cooking and enjoying Harry Potter movies. She also adores pasta, burgers, and sandwiches. Kristen’s favourite celebs are Tom Cruise and Sheila McCarthy. Following that, the couple decided to end their relationship, and he developed a strong interest in Kristen. The couple began dating while she was on tour with the band, and she became pregnant as a result. He chose to leave the band after learning he was going to be a parent, understanding that he was still experiencing troubles with his profession following his breakup with Nicks.</p><p>He also didn’t want to be a burden to the band, having watched other musicians struggle with their bands after having children. Lindsey was encouraged to pursue competitive swimming at an early age but abandoned it when he developed a stronger interest in music. Lindsey, on the other hand, was self-taught. He was inspired by folk, folk-rock, and psychedelic music as a child, which led to the founding of his first band, “The Fritz Rabyne Memorial Band.” At the time, he was close friends with Stevie Nicks and urged her to join his band. Following that, the couple called it quits and began dating.</p><p>In the early 1970s, they began making demos, which led to them signing with Polydor Records and releasing the album “Buckingham Nicks,” but they were shortly dropped due to the album failing to meet expectations. Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, on the other hand, listened to the album’s tracks and was influenced by the guitar sections. He also invited Buckingham to join their band, but Buckingham refused to come without Nicks, so Fleetwood agreed to his terms. Fleetwood Mac’s debut album, presenting their newly formed pair, was released in 1975 and soared to the top of the US charts. Lindsey became a major factor in the band’s songwriting, delivering multiple singles.</p><h2><span id=Kristen_Messner_Net_worth>Kristen Messner Net worth</span></h2><p><strong>Kristen Messner has an estimated Net worth of $1.5 million.</strong> In addition, her annual income is around $900,000.
