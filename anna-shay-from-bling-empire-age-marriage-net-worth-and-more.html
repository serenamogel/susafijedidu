Needless to say, quite a lot of well-known names like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Yeoh</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Awkwafina</a> have been brought into the limelight, thanks to the movie’s worldwide success.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>In 2021, Netflix aired a show with a similar theme, which also attracted popular attention, and it wasn’t long enough before reality television fans were again given an insight into the exorbitantly wealthy and fabulous lives of Asian Americans residing in Los Angeles.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>This is none other than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bling Empire</strong></a>, which became an instant hit and solidified its position as a fan favorite. Every Bling Empire cast member has achieved immense popularity in addition to their wealth, but there’s one name that somehow stands out from the rest. This is one of the most renowned cast members: Anna Shay.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Anna Shay is the name that will be included in any conversation about Netflix’s hit show Bling Empire. We don’t know much about Shay, except that she has managed to acquire a massive fortune for herself, which makes her a perfect fit for a show that centers around rich people. Let’s get to know more about the Bling Empire star.</p><h2 id=h-anna-shay-age-marriage-net-worth-and-more data-injectable=false><strong>Anna Shay: Age, marriage, net worth, and more</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Anna-Shay.jpg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Born on Dec. 31, 1960, Shay has presently acquired recognition as a fashion icon, social media influencer, philanthropist, and television personality. Bling Empire’s success has catapulted her into public notice, and as she continues to acquire more fame along the way, the viewers and fans are interested to know more about her personal life and the source of her income.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>The reality TV star, 62, was born into wealth and luxury. Her father is the billionaire businessman Edward Shay, who founded Pacific Architects and Engineers, an arms and defense contractor which has NASA and the United Nations among its clients. He died in 1995 when Anna was 35 years old. The show has various moments where Anna’s father’s occupation is recalled.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>In one of the episodes, her co-star Kane Lim mentioned that Shay’s wealth emanates “from weapons” and that her father “sells bombs, guns, defense technology, and its worth, like, a few billion.” Her mother Ai Oizumi Shay is half-Japanese and half-Russian, which signifies that Shay has both ancestries. She gathered a hefty fortune by selling her father’s company in 2006 with her brother Allen Shay for nearly $1.2 billion. Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth stands at $600 million</a> as of now.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=false>Not much light has been shed on Shay’s personal life, except that she was married four times. However, the details of her ex-husbands have been kept a secret, primarily because of her reluctance to disclose the details of her private life in public. The only piece of information that we know of Shay — which is related to her past relationships — is that she has a 28-year-old son named Kenny Kemp who, not unlike his mother, prefers to keep a low profile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sur7rAZqqhmalis7O7zGaZpaGenHqmuc%2BiqZ5lkZyybrnAq6mimZeaeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqiusNmpKiqlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
