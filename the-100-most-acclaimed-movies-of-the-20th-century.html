I no longer have any recollection of the formula I used, but I'm sure it was at least as complicated as the one for Coca-Cola. I know (given my personal bent) that I weighted, for example, the "Sight & Sound" international critics' poll more highly than, say, the Oscars. And I tried to find a mathematical way to properly consider and weigh American with non-English-language films (given the restrictions and biases of some sources), and older films with newer ones. The sources I used were (in no particular order): Academy Awards, "Sight & Sound" polls (1952, '62, '72, '82, '92), the first AFI 100 list, the National Film Registry (American films selected for preservation in the Library of Congress -- which had to be at least 10 years old), the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards (1975 - ), the New York Film Critics Circle (1935 - ), and the National Society of Film Critics (1966 - ).</p><p>Although it seems inconceivable to me now, I actually put together several charts (spreadsheets!), so you could view the lists and the movies' individual honors, not only by <a href=#>rank</a>, but by <a href=#>director</a>, <a href=#>title (alphabetically)</a>, <a href=#>year/decade</a>, -- and a comprehensive list of the <a href=#>400+ titles</a> that came under consideration, given my sources.</p><p>I doubt -- and I hope -- I will never be that anal again. But what I liked about the results was that they reflected a mix of "art films" ("<a href=#>The Passion of Joan of Arc</a>," "<a href=#>The Bicycle Thief</a>"), silents ("<a href=#>Greed</a>," "Intolerance," "The Gold Rush") and popular titles ("<a href=#>West Side Story</a>," "<a href=#>Annie Hall</a>," "<a href=#>Schindler's List</a>"). I was also pleased with the distribution over the decades, a little more balanced than you usually see in polls: two films from the 1910s; six from the '20s; 19 from the '30s; 16 from the '40s; 29 from the '50s; 19 from the '60s; 21 from the '70s; 13 from the '80s; and 14 from the '90s (which weren't quite over yet).</p><p>Point of interest: Bergman had three films on the list: "<a href=#>Persona</a>" (22), "Wild Strawberries" (66), and "<a href=#>Fanny and Alexander</a>" (84). Antonioni had one: "L'Avventura" (8).</p><p>Welles and Chaplin each had two films in the top 25. Other directors represented in the upper quarter include: <a href=#>Jean Renoir</a>, <a href=#>Alfred Hitchcock</a>, <a href=#>Federico Fellini</a>, Sergei Eisenstein, <a href=#>Stanley Donen</a>, <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href=#>John Ford</a>, <a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a>, Vittorio <a href=#>De Sica</a>, <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>, Erich von Stroheim, <a href=#>Elia Kazan</a>, <a href=#>Carl Theodor Dreyer</a>, <a href=#>Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a>, <a href=#>Robert Wise</a>, D.W. Griffith, Jean Vigo, and Michael Curtiz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrJuRo7umvtJoq6GdXWZ9cXnMqKqtZZGYsK2tyKacnWWdpMOqsdJmpp9lpJ2ybn6PrZ9mm5Wjwba%2B2A%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
