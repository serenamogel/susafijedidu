For performances of “the BLACK seminole.” and “drive ME crazy!,” Yachty brought out Diana Gordon, who contributes vocals to the studio versions of both songs.</p><p>On stage, Yachty was backed by an all-women band in addition to Gordon. Speaking with Zane Lowe of Apple Music 1 in January, he explained his reasoning for going with just ladies. “I just feel like women don’t get as much respect as men when it comes to the music industry,” Yachty said at the time. “So I was like, ‘These songs are pretty badass, and I want to show women playing them.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-yachty-at-rolling-loud>Lil Yachty At Rolling Loud</h2></span><p>INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 05: Lil Yachty performs during 2023 Rolling Loud Los Angeles at Hollywood Park Grounds on March 05, 2023 in Inglewood, California.

Speaking about the decision to go in that direction, Yachty previously said: “I think I created it just because I really wanted to be taken serious as an artist, you know. Not just some SoundCloud rapper, not some mumble rapper. Not some guy that just made one hit. I wanted to be really taken serious because music is, like, everything to me. I respect all walks of music, not just rap and hip-hop, everything. So I think I wanted to make something to show the world just how great it was to me.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode of Saturday Night Live, Quinta Brunson served as the host. During her opening monologue, the Abbott Elementary star promoted her show by taking a jab at Friends. “It’s a network sitcom like, say, Friends. Except, instead of being about a group of friends, it’s about a group of teachers. Instead of New York, it’s in Philadelphia and instead of not having Black people, it does," she joked. The show also tackled <a href=# rel>Donald Trump's recent indictment</a>, featured an April Fools prank from Michael Che, and much more.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-yachty-on-snl>Lil Yachty On "SNL"</h2></span><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoB4fpVmo6KkXa6upLTTsmSpnaKbvLO50maroZ1dl7mir8pmqp6lmaO8rbGMnamirpViuqZ5wquYs7FdpLtuv82l</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
