Focused on the Rivera family, Coco <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tells the story</a> of Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), an aspiring musician who attempts to break the band his family has on music.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>In his escapades, he unintentionally causes himself to become invisible to the living but can now see the dead.

Before he emerged as Cassian Andor, Diego Luna starred as Manolo Sanchez, a young man who wants to be a musician rather than follow his family’s legacy. Somehow, he ends up with his deceased family in the Land of the Remembered. Sound familiar?</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>While on paper, The Book of Life and Coco have a lot in common; the films have wildly different takes on their family drama, as well as the source of conflict for each movie. Plus, though The Book of Life features some original songs, it takes on more of a jukebox musical vibe with performances of “Can’t Help Falling In Love With You,” “Creep,” and even “Just a Friend.” You can stream The Book of Life on Max.</p><h2 id=h-day-of-the-dead-a-celebration-of-life data-injectable=false>Day of the Dead: A Celebration of Life</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>While watching fictional stories about Dia de los Muertos are great, for those <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unfamiliar with the holiday</a>, many of the film’s most prominent moments may be lost on them.
