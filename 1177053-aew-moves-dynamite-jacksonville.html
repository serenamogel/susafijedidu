All Elite Wrestling has just noted via Twitter that their show next week will not take place in Rochester, NY. Instead, the taping will emanate from their home base in Jacksonville, FL. AEW has pushed back their date in Rochester to July 8 and will honor prior tickets or offer refunds to fans who were planning to attend.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This show will be televised live on TNT from Daily’s Place, and be managed under a restricted attendance policy. The DYNAMITE show in Rochester will be rescheduled for Wednesday, July 8, at Blue Cross Arena.</p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>March 12, 2020</a></p><p>The schedule reshuffling comes after several restrictions on public gatherings in the whole of New York, as well as a declared State of Emergency in the region. AEW has also announced that their March 25 episode, which was to take place in Newark, NJ, will also be moved, although a location for that event is still to be announced. Fans in NJ can similarly wait for the rescheduled July 22 date or procure refunds. AEW stated in their final tweet that they will continue to monitor the situation and make more changes as the situation evolves.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We appreciate your understanding as the safety and well-being of our fans and talent is always our top priority. We will continue to closely monitor this evolving situation related to COVID-19 and be guided by government officials, health organizations and venue management.</p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>March 12, 2020</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBwbmltY2KupsOMpqavnaNisbq6wKagrZ1dn66kt9Kopa%2BhnKGy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
