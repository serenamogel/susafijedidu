Through the first five episodes, the two men were arguably the most popular contestants on Squid Game: The Challenge.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately for them and their fans, Stephen and Rick’s run for the $4.56 million came to a crashing halt in episode 5.
