That decade, he starred in several blockbuster films, including Christopher Nolan’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman</a> trilogy, 3:10 to Yuma, The Prestige, and The Machinist. He also voiced Howl in Studio Ghibli’s beloved anime movie Howl’s Moving Castle.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>And around 10 years after dropping a chainsaw onto a victim running down a stairwell, he won an Academy Award for his supporting role in 2010’s The Fighter.</p><h2 id=h-bale-revealed-bateman-s-age-in-the-movie-s-legendary-opener data-injectable=false>Bale revealed Bateman’s age in the movie’s legendary opener</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Bateman was older than Bale’s actual age at the time of filming — but only by a year or so. We learned Bateman was in his mid-20s during the movie’s famous opener, which featured the banker going through his extensive morning routine.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>“I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor,” Bateman said in a voiceover narration. “My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself in a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches — I can do 1,000 now.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>After going through his facial and body routine, which included an excessive number of different cleansers, scrubs, and moisturizers, Bale dropped several lines that perfectly encapsulated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the journey we were about to embark on</a>.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=false>“There’s an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction,” Bateman said. “But, there is no real me — only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmm5intrTAyJqlZpqRobJutc1mmKadop6worqMqaqym5ikfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 Blogsia - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
